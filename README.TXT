This project is part of the material for the book

   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a second version of the technical support system 
example. It is an intermediate version intended to demonstrate the first
few changes discussed in this book chapter.


To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.


24)It has a key and a value it associates the key to the value.
26)we check the entries by using size()
28)it will replace the old value.
29) it will be counted as 2 diffrent values
30)containsKey(Object key)
31)the get methode will return null as an answer
32)for (String name : phoneBook.keySet())
    {
        System.out.println("Key: " + name);
    }
34)similarities(both are used to store a collection of objects)
    diffrences
    arraylist(the elements are accessed by index)
    hashset(must contain unique elements, is backed by hash table)
35)the order in hashset will contain only unique word and cant be predictable
    in arraylist everything will be returned doesnt matter if its 
    a duplicate and it will be printed in order.
36)yes it is a problem because now we just have an extra empty string
